##DAY5
- Arduino serial data published to ROS topic
- Replaced simulated data with real hardware input
- Full Arduino → ROS → subscriber → logger pipeline working
- System runs from a single launch file
- integrated an IR sensor with ROS 2 using Arduino and serial communication, publishing real-time obstacle detection
